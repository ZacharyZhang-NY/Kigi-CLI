# Kigi — agent/developer notes

Single source of truth for how this repository is organized and the
constraints every change must respect. Update this file whenever the tech
stack or product direction changes.

## What this is

Kigi is an unofficial Kimi Code CLI community build: a hard fork of
xai-org/grok-build (Apache-2.0, Rust) re-targeted at the Kimi Code
subscription API and the Moonshot open platform. It coexists with the
official `kimi` CLI: binary `kigi`, config dir `~/.kigi`
(`KIGI_SHARE_DIR` override), keyring service `kigi`, env prefix `KIGI_*`.
Never read or write `~/.kimi` (except the explicit one-time read-only
import) or any `KIMI_*` env var.

## Hard constraints

- **Zero egress**: outbound connections are limited to
  `auth.kimi.com`, `api.kimi.com`, `api.moonshot.cn`, `api.moonshot.ai`,
  GitHub Releases domains, and user-configured MCP servers. No telemetry,
  no analytics, ever. `crates/codegen/kigi-env` is the single home of
  first-party endpoints.
- **Toolchain**: Rust 1.97.0 (rust-toolchain.toml), edition 2024.
- **Gates** (all must stay green):
  `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`,
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` (zero warnings),
  `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo deny check advisories`.
- **Observability is local**: `kigi-log` (unified session log, `--debug`
  firehose, subsystem file logs, opt-in instrumentation) writes under
  `~/.kigi` only. Its zero-network property is a contract.
- The root `Cargo.toml` is hand-maintained (upstream's generator is not in
  this repo). Members sorted; versions inherited from
  `workspace.package.version` (0.1.0).

## Layout

- `crates/codegen/` — the bulk of the application (62 `kigi-*` crates).
  Key ones: `kigi-bin` (binary `kigi`), `kigi-tui` (full-screen TUI +
  headless `-p` mode + `acp`/`mcp` commands), `kigi-shell` (agent runtime,
  leader-follower IPC, sessions), `kigi-sampler` (inference client;
  ChatCompletions/Responses/Messages backends), `kigi-auth` (credentials),
  `kigi-config` (config layering, `~/.kigi` paths), `kigi-env` (endpoints),
  `kigi-tools` (tool implementations incl. codex/opencode ports — see its
  THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), `kigi-workspace` (FS/VCS/exec/permissions,
  checkpoint/worktree), `kigi-log` (local observability).
- `crates/common/`, `crates/build/`, `prod/mc/` — shared libs, proto build,
  proxy wire types (the latter to be redefined against Kimi in M1).
- `third_party/` — vendored Mermaid rendering stack (untouched policy).
- `bin/protoc` — dotslash launcher used by proto codegen.

## Storage discipline

- Tests that touch the filesystem MUST use `tempfile::TempDir` (drop
  cleans up) — never bare `std::env::temp_dir()` + `create_dir_all`,
  which leaks directories into the OS temp root forever.
- `target/` grows past 150GB across repeated full-workspace builds
  (incremental is already off); run `cargo clean` when it exceeds
  ~50GB and at milestone boundaries.
- Graph node worktrees are removed right after a successful merge-back;
  only FAILED nodes keep theirs for postmortem.

## Test seams

Cross-crate test hooks are behind the `test-support` cargo feature
(kigi-workspace, kigi-pager-render, kigi-config, kigi-tui), enabled via
dependents' `[dev-dependencies]`. Don't expose new test seams as plain
`#[cfg(test)]` items across crate boundaries.

## Graph mode (`/graph`, post-0.1.x — plan.md in the parent dir)

A deterministic DAG scheduler layered over the goal engine: `/graph
<objective>` decomposes the objective into nodes (graph planner subagent
→ Agentproof-style static gate in `graph_plan.rs`), then executes each
node as one ordinary goal — the agentic loop lives INSIDE the node; the
edges stay deterministic Rust. The harness appends a terminal
`gn-final` verification node depending on every planner node.

- Feature flag `KIGI_GRAPH=1` (default off); availability additionally
  requires the goal harness (`BuiltinGate::Graph`).
- Key modules (kigi-shell): `session/graph_tracker.rs` (pure state
  machine; reuses `GoalStatus`/`GoalPhase`/`GoalPauseReason`),
  `session/graph_plan.rs` (planner-JSON contract + validation + fnv id
  canonicalization), `session/graph_planner.rs` (planner runner, reuses
  the goal planner spawn plumbing),
  `session/acp_session_impl/graph.rs` (orchestration seam).
- Seam points: `handle_prompt` intercepts GraphSet/GraphResume; the
  in-turn loop's `EndTurn` arm calls `run_graph_round_end()` to advance
  nodes within the same turn; goal auto-pauses cascade to the graph in
  `auto_pause_goal_if_active_inner`; node goals are armed with the
  REMAINING graph budget so `enforce_goal_token_budget` cascades trips.
- Persistence: `PersistenceMsg::GraphModeState(Option<..>)` →
  `<session_dir>/graph/state.json` (`None` tombstones after clear);
  immutable per-version baselines `graph/graph.baseline.v{N}.json`;
  per-node goal artifacts archived to `graph/<node_id>/`. Restore
  demotes `Active`→`UserPaused` and `Running`→`Ready` (re-run is safe:
  the verifier gates completion).
- `/goal` and `/graph` are mutually exclusive while the graph owns the
  engine; e2e suite: `acp_session_tests/graph/graph_e2e_tests.rs`.
- Parallel fan-out (G1): with `KIGI_GRAPH_CONCURRENCY > 1` (default 3,
  clamp [1,8]) and ≥2 `Ready` nodes, `drive_graph` runs batches via
  `acp_session_impl/graph_workers.rs` — per node a bounded
  worker↔verifier subagent loop (`KIGI_GRAPH_NODE_ROUNDS`, default 3;
  `general-purpose` children; worktree isolation on round 1, resume
  keeps context+worktree on later rounds; `NODE_RESULT:` /
  `NODE_VERDICT:` terminal contracts parsed fail-closed), then
  SEQUENTIAL merge-back via `kigi_workspace::worktree::apply_worktree`
  (`ApplyMode::Merge`); a conflict fails the node and blocks its
  dependents while other chains continue. `gn-final` always runs
  serially on the full goal engine. Concurrency=1 is byte-identical to
  the serial G0 path. Ceiling: a worker round exceeding the foreground
  subagent await budget (600s) is cancelled and retried via resume.
- G2: `BudgetLimited` is resumable — a budget trip demotes in-flight
  nodes to `Ready` (resource stop, not a verdict) and
  `/graph resume --budget <tokens>` re-arms with fresh headroom. The
  pager shows a graph status chip driven by the `GraphUpdated` wire
  variant (`extensions/notification.rs`), emitted from the single
  `persist_graph_state` chokepoint (checkpoint ⇔ badge tick); old
  pagers degrade via `#[serde(other)] Unknown`. PTY scenarios:
  `graph_slash_presession{,_disabled}.yaml`.
- G3: dynamic replan. `DISCOVERED: <text>` line markers (fence-stripped,
  placeholder-filtered) from workers/verifiers/the serial node's final
  text queue as `pending_discoveries`; at each dispatch boundary
  `maybe_replan_graph` (`acp_session_impl/graph_replan.rs`) runs a
  replanner subagent producing an APPEND-ONLY appendix
  (`validate_replan`: existing-id deps allowed, edges onto `gn-final`
  rejected — they would cycle after the final-gating extension),
  bumps `plan_version`, freezes `graph.baseline.v{N}.json`, and regates
  `gn-final` (Ready→Waiting). Bounded by `KIGI_GRAPH_REPLAN_CAP`
  (default 3, 0 = off); past the cap — and after the final node has
  achieved — discoveries drain to history only. Replan failure degrades
  (history + notice); it never pauses a working graph.

## Milestones (PRD §8.3)

- M0 (done): rename, deletions (voice/telemetry/announcements/marketplace/
  relay-gateway), toolchain, gates.
- M1: Kimi device-flow auth (F1), Moonshot API-key channel (F2), inference
  via ChatCompletions (F3), dynamic model sync (F4). The auth stack in
  `kigi-shell/src/auth` + `kigi-auth` gets rewritten here; transitional
  grok.com references live only there and in `kigi-sampler`/proxy types.
- M2: server-side search/fetch (F5), command parity with kimi-cli 1.49.0
  (F6), one-time `~/.kimi/config.toml` import (F7), F9 smoke list, perf CI.
- M3: GitHub Releases distribution, install scripts, self-update (F8).
